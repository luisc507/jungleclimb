                                            Hello, my name is Luis Carranza, I have been a local climber for over a decade. I started this project because I felt the need to spread information about climbing in Panam√° for the purpose of leaving a record of what the local climbers have been doing for the last few years. I choose to open my on website because I also wanted to learn coding and express my creativity in a free way, this was not possible via existing websites due to the fact that they have their own stablished templates. This is for the adventurous climbers who are looking forward to escape the city and experience what other climbers have already done in the past, keeping the history alive. I do not own any of
                                            the
                                            lands mentioned on this site or take any responsability
                                            on the user's management of the information mentioned. Whoever I'm still trying my best to deliver the details
                                            as
                                            accurate as possible and work with the respective landlords for the allowance of climbers in their lands.<br>
